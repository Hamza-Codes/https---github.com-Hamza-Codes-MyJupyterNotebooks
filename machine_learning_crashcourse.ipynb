    "Artificial intelligence refers to the general ability of computers to emulate human thought and perform tasks in real-world environments. Artificial intelligence is basically telling computers to do a task based on a specific input. For example, printing \"You are young\" based on the input age of a user.| An application of artificial intelligence that includes algorithms that parse data, learn from that data, and then apply what theyâ€™ve learned to make informed decisions. Machine learning refers to the technologies and algorithms that enable systems to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve themselves through experience and data. ML is basically doing the same thing but based on data rather than user input. Everyone under the age of 40 is considered young, for example. ML detects the patterns on its own without us telling it explicitly and predicts the output. This is a data driven approach. | All deep learning is machine learning, but not all machine learning is deep learning. A deep learning model is designed to continually analyze data with a logical structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions. To complete this analysis, deep learning applications use a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network. Deep learning is considered an evolution of machine learning. It uses a programmable neural network that enables machines to make accurate decisions without help from humans.\n",
